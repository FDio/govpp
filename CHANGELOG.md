### Binapi Generator

- the generator code has been split into multiple packages:
    - [vppapi](binapigen/vppapi) - parses VPP API (`.api.json`) files
    - [binapigen](binapigen) - processes parsed VPP API files and handles code generation
- added support for VPP enumflags type
- previously required manual patches for generated code should no longer be needed
- many generated aliases were removed and referenced to `*_types` files for simpler reading
- any types imported from other VPP API (`*_types.api`) files are now automatically resolved for generated Go code
- marshal/unmarshal methods for memory client messages are now generated
- generated new helper methods for more convenient IP and MAC address conversion
- RPC service code is now generated into a separated file (`*_rpc.ba.go`) in the same directory and uses a new low level
  stream API
- added option to generate HTTP handlers for RPC services
- generated code now contains comments with information about versions of VPP and binapi-generator
- in addition to the file name, the binapi generator now accepts full path (including extension,
  e.g. `/usr/share/vpp/api/core/vpe.api.json`)
- dependency on `github.com/lunixbochs/struc` was removed
- generated helper methods for `vpe_types.Timestamp`
- generated API messages comment may contain additional information about the given API development state (in progress,
  deprecated)
- type `[]bool` is now known to the generator
- enhanced VPP version resolution - the generator is more reliable to evaluate installed VPP version

### Features

- [socketclient](adapter/socketclient) was optimized and received a new method to add client name
- added new API [stream](api/api.go) for low-level access to VPP API
    - the `Stream` API uses the same default values as the `Channel` API
    - it supports the same functional options (request size, reply size, reply timeout)
- [statsclient](adapter/statsclient) supports additional options (retry period, retry timeout)
- the compatibility check error now contains a list of compatible and incompatible messages wrapped
  as `CompatibilityError`
- removed global binary API adapter. This change allows GoVPP to manage multiple VPP connections with different sockets
  simultaneously
- added support for the stats v2. The `statsclient` adapter recognizes the version automatically so the `StatsAPI`
  remains unchanged. In relation to this change, the legacy support (i.e. stat segment v0) for VPP <=19.04 was dropped.
- GoVPP now recognizes VPP state `NotResponding` which can be used to prevent disconnecting in case the VPP hangs or is
  overloaded
- added method `SetLogger()` for setting the global logger
- `StatsAPI` has a new method `GetMemory()` retrieving values related to the statseg memory heap
- the stats socket allows an option to connect asynchronously in the same manner as the API socket connection.
  Use `AsyncConnectStats()` to receive `ConnectionEvent` notifications
- Instead of a cumulative value, the `statsclient` error counter now provides a value per worker
- `ListStats(patterns ...string)` returns `StatIdentifier` containing the message name and the ID (instead of the name
  only)
- added support for VPP stat symlinks
- GoVPP received its own [API trace](api/trace.go). See the [example](examples/api-trace) for more details.

### Fixes

- `MsgCodec` will recover panic occurring during a message decoding
- calling `Unsubscibe` will close the notification channel
- GoVPP omits to send `sockclnt_delete` while cleaning up socket clients in order to remove VPP duplicated close
  complaints - VPP handles it itself
- fixed major bug causing GoVPP to not receive stats updates after VPP restart
- fixed name conflict in generated union field constructors
- the size of unions composed of other unions is now calculated correctly
- fixed race condition in the VPP adapter mock
- fixed crash caused by the return value of uint kind
- fixed encoding/decoding of float64
- fixed the stats reconnect procedure which occasionally failed re-enable the connection.
- fixed occasional panic during disconnect
- `statsclient` wait for socket procedure works properly
- fixed memory leak in health check

### Other

- improved log messages to provide more relevant info
- updated extras/libmemif to be compatible with the latest VPP changes
- default health check parameter was increased to 250 milliseconds (up from 100 milliseconds), and the default threshold
  was increased to 2 (up from 1)
- improved decoding of message context (message evaluation uses also the package path, not just the message ID)
- `statsclient` now recognizes between empty stat directories and does not treat them as unknown
- proxy client was updated to VPP 20.05

#### Examples

- added more code samples of working with unions in [binapi-types](examples/binapi-types)
- added profiling mode to [perf bench](examples/perf-bench) example
- improved [simple client](examples/simple-client) example to work properly even with multiple runs
- added [multi-vpp](examples/multi-vpp) example displaying management of two VPP instances from single application
- added [stream-client](examples/stream-client) example showing usage of the new stream API
- [simple client](examples/simple-client) and [binapi-types](examples/binapi-types) examples show usage of
  the `vpe_types.Timestamp`
- added [API trace example](examples/api-trace)

#### Dependencies

- updated `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` dep to `v1.6.0`
- updated `github.com/lunixbochs/struc` dep to `v0.0.0-20200521075829-a4cb8d33dbbe`
